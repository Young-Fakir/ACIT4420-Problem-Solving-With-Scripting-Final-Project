Part 2 - Conway’s game of life simulator

Conway’s Game of Life Simulator
------------------------------------

Overview:
This project is a console-based simulation of Conway’s Game of Life. It contains:
- Interactive mode and batch execution.
- Multiple rule sets (Conway, HighLife, Day & Night, Life 3/4).
- Different pattern formats: RLE, coordinate-based, plain-text, and Life 1.06.
- Ability to save board snapshots in text or binary format.
- Toroidal (wrap) or fixed boundary conditions.
- Pattern loading, saving, and conversion.


Project structure:

main.py
    Main entry point. Provides:
    - Command-line argument parsing.
    - Interactive mode (command prompt).
    - Batch mode simulation.
    - Snapshot saving.
    - Logging to console and game_of_life.log.

board.py
    Implements the Board class:
    - Stores and displays the grid.
    - get_cell/set_cell, clear, resize, randomize.
    - step and step_n (simulation steps).
    - Snapshot saving (text or binary).
    - Board statistics: generation, live cells, density, etc.

pattern_parser.py
    Implements PatternParser:
    Supports loading/saving:
        - RLE format
        - Plain text
        - Coordinate files
        - Life 1.06
    Allows converting formatting and writing to new pattern files.

rules.py
    Contains rule registration and evaluation system:
    - Built-in rule sets: conway, high_life, day_and_night, life_34.
    - Evolve_grid() and apply_rule().
    - Easy rule extensibility.

Log file:

Requirements:

Python 3.10+
numpy

Install with:
    pip install numpy


Running the program:

1. Interactive mode:

    python main.py --interactive

Available commands include:
    load [file]
    rule <name>
    boundary <fixed|toroidal>
    run <generations>
    step
    display
    save <file>
    backtrack
    info
    help
    quit / exit

If no pattern exists, sample patterns are created automatically.

2. Batch mode:

    python main.py -p glider.rle -g 20 -r conway -W 40 -H 20 -b toroidal

Useful arguments:
    --pattern, -p        pattern file
    --generations, -g    number of generations
    --rule, -r           rule set
    --width, -W          board width
    --height, -H         board height
    --boundary, -b       fixed or toroidal
    --interactive, -i    start interactive mode


Board & simulation details:

Data structure:
    2D numpy boolean array for the grid.

Board features:
    resize, display, clear, randomize.
    get_statistics() reports:
        generation, width, height, live cells, density, etc.

Boundary modes:
    fixed or wrap-around (toroidal).

RULES:
    conway (B3/S23)
    high_life (B36/S23)
    day_and_night (B3678/S34678)
    life_34 (B34/S34)

Adding custom rules:
    Use @register_rule("name")
    Return 0 or 1 based on neighbors and current state.


Pattern file formats:


RLE:
    o = live, b = dead, $ = new row, ! = end.

Plain Text:
    Characters like X, O, * = live.
    Dots or spaces = dead.

Coordinate files:
    One (x,y) per line.

Life 1.06:
    Optional header: #Life 1.06
    Lines of "x y".

PATTERN SAVING:
    plain      -> O and .
    coordinates
    life106


Snapshots:

Text format:
    Human readable board with header and symbols.

Binary format:
    Header contains width, height, generation.
    Payload contains packed cell bits.


Logging:

Logging writes to:
    game_of_life.log

Modules use logging for:
    information, warnings, and file handling.
